    Growing up, i had the best memories that shaped uo my personality.I used to play a lot of games with my friends and family members that shaped up my personality and created great memories.From fishing together to playing football together even during the rainy seasons was such a splendind thing.We also had family trips that made us bond more together and become one.Last but not least, our relationship with God was always splendid.We usually go to church together making us become closer to God and have good behaviour.
