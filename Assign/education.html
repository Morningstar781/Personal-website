    <h2>As for everyone, there education journey begins at primary level.I started my education journey at Nairobi, Kangemi at a small school at the time known as Bright Morning Star.It was quite a small school at the time with few students as it had just been open.It was privately owned school by a lady known as Madam Beatrice(i cannot remember all her names).I joined the school on 2007 under the previous education system of 8-4-4.It was quite a great moment. </h2>

    <h2>I studied at the school for about 5 years then we relocated to the countryside.That made me change schools.I joined a new school known as Good Hope Academy in Vihiga County. The change of environment was quite something but i had to quickly adjust to it. As for any private school around the world, discipline is always upholded. The teachers were always strict and no-nonsense in any way possible. Passing exams was always mandatory. I studied at the school till i finished my primary school education where i performed well to qualify to join a national school.</h2>
